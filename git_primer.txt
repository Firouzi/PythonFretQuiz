Sequence for starting a new project:
1. PROJECT (create the project eg Unity project)
2. REPO (create the local repo w/ SourceTree)
3. IGNORE (setup the ignore file)
4. REMOTE (setup the remote repository on GitHub)
5. PUSH (Push local Repo to Remote repo)


1. Project:
Just create your new project

2. Repo:
Source Tree -> Local -> + Create
Path is the path to the folder which will be the base of the repo

3. Ignore
Can get the 'official' gitIgnore from:
https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore

4. Remote
Create a new repo on Github
do NOT add a Readme, gitignore (already done) or license
	This will cause a conflict when we try to push!
Copy the URL link (prob HTTPS)
On Source Tree, goto your bookmarked project -> "Repository" Menu -> Add Remote

5. Push
Click Push, choose the branch and the remote repo (can name it origin, we named it "GitHub")

You may need to solve a credentials quirk in source tree:
